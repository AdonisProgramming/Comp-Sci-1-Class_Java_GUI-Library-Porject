Book Library Application

You are required to create a GUI application for a Book Library. 

The Application must display a splash screen, Add Book Screen, Delete Book Screen and Find Book Screen. 

Each book class should have a Book ISBN, Book Title, Book Author and Book year published. 

Pls. use array lists to add, delete and modify student details. 

You will notice that you would not be able to save the data  permanently as there is no database in place, and this is fine.
